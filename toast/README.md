Problem Statement: Toast Notification Component with Auto-Hide
Objective:
Create a reusable Toast Notification Component in React that supports three types of notifications:

Success (Green background)
Warning (Yellow/Orange background)
Error (Red background)
Each toast should display:

A message
An icon representing the type
Auto-hide after a specified duration (e.g., 3â€“5 seconds)
A close button to dismiss it manually
Requirements:
Implement the toast as a React component.
Allow dynamic messages and toast types (success, warning, error).
Auto-hide functionality after a specified time.
Include a manual close button.
Position to the top-right or bottom-right of the screen.
Support multiple toasts appearing one after another (stacking).
I'll generate images for how the toast notifications should look. Give me a moment.



Here is the image showcasing how the toast notifications should look. Let me know if you need any modifications! Would you also like me to provide the React code for this component?
